# Portfolio

This repository includes projects that were done during my time at Carleton College. These projects were part of coursework for certain classes.
All of them required substantial amount of time and so I decided to display that hard work here.

The three projects include:

 1. A data driven website.

 2. A data visualisation.

 3. An interpreter for the programming language of scheme.

More information is provided in the README file for each project.
