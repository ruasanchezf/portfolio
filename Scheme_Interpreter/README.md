# Interpreter for Scheme 

This project was the culmination of several components created through the course of a term. It was assigned by 
a class: "Programming Languages." The goal of this project is to create an basic interpreter for the Scheme language using 
the object oriented C language. We did not attempt to create a complete interpreter, instead it was to cover the most
basic edge cases in Scheme. 

This was a partner assignment with James Craig that was completed during my junior year. It took approximately 4-5 weeks to complete.
The interpreter was turned in with sections at a time, each submisison having required tests. The test files present were the ones for 
the final submission and thus are the most complex tests. These test were a benchmark for our interpreter and were provided by the 
class instructor.
