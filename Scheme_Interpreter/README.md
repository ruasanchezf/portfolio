# Interpreter for Scheme 

This project was the culmination of several components created through the course of a term. It was assigned by 
a class: "Programming Languages." The goal of this project is to create an basic interpreter for the Scheme language using 
the object oriented C language. We did not attempt to create a complete interpreter, instead it was to cover the most
basic edge cases in Scheme.
