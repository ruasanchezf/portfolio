# Data driven web design project

This project was done during my sophmore year at Carleton. It was done as a final project for a web design class.
This was a group assingment and was completed in the course of a couple of weeks by me and two other teammates: 
Haruki Yoshida and Miguel Alvarez.

I was primarily in charge of the front end development, particularly the HTML and CSS files. The main goal of the project
was to showcase the design conventions we learned during class. My teammates and I did not get a chance to have the website
work with real time data.
