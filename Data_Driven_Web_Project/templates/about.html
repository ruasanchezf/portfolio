            <p> The data is compiled from many different sources such as: "peer-reviewed studies, government reports, mainstream media, non-profits, private websites, blogs, and crowd-sourced lists." All data has been analzed, filtered, deconflicted, and cross-referenced. This dataset is updated as more data becomes available and is then entered into the existing database. </p>
