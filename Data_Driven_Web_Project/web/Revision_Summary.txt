Revision on UI assignment

NOTE: The code in web folder is designed to work in browser. The code that will work on perlman is different.

We chose this code because it will give us back the most points and this was a part of the web page we were
not sure of how it would look like at the time we were working on this assignment.
We wanted to change the layout now that we have a better understanding of the assignment and what we can do
with the things we learned so far.

Changes
1. Replaced the image with a sample data table
	Made it clear how our webpage would present our data. The actual code we will use to create the data table
	is presented in the comments but for now, we have a java script code that would create the sample data to
	present.

2. Got rid of the long java script code
	We changed the layout of the page and in that process we got rid of some of the java script code that was too long.
	We do have a small portion of java script code but we decided it was not enough to create separate file for it.
	The java script code we used for our sample table will not be existent in the real code.

3. Made the page understandable in terms of layout and language
	We changed the layout and language of the page. We created a side bar where users can narrow down their desired data.
	We worked on making the options clear with easy to understand instructions and also made sure when users put in an invalid
	input we alert them.
	We also made the buttons look clickable so that the user knows his/her options.
